# YABS
Yet Another Beam Solver - This toolbox helps you getting an estimatation of the beam structure natural frequencies , given various environmental boundary conditions 


# What can you do with this ? 

&check; Get frequencies and mode shape of the 2D euler beam 
&check; Apply soil stiffness
&check; Apply Top mass and Mass moment of Inertia 
&check; Get an illustration from the beam and its selected options.

# Planned to be released:
- [ ] Introduce geometrical softening.
- [ ] Introduce Soil P-Y curves and activate tangent/secant methods.
- [ ] preloaded frequency/modeshape calculation.
- [ ] Introduce Hydrodynamics into the mode shape calcualtion. 
- [ ] Timoshenko beam solver.
